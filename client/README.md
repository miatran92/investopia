## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- React Router Dom
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - For frontend
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - For backend
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - For backend

### What I learned

- The hardest bit of this was definitely learning how to work with Alpaca API for creating a frontend and connect to the backend. 

- The biggest lesson I learned is that documentation is one of the greatest resources when buildin a project like this. I was able to achieve more than I thought possible because I took my time to familiarize mysef with Alpaca documentation.

- In conclusion, I can say that building my very first fullstack app from scratch has been an amazing journey and invaluable learning experience.

### Continued development

- Add cancel order feature
- Add user authentication
- Improve error handling

### Useful resources

- [Alpaca API Official Docs](https://alpaca.markets/docs/introduction/) - This helped me tremendously learn about working with a third party API. I really liked this API and will use it going forward.
